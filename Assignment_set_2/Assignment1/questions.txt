Problem Statement
Download the dataset from ‘https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/string-algorithm/string-searching/practice-problems/machine-learning/predict-ad-clicks/’
Split train and test data in 70:30 ratio using ‘Stratified split’ and save test data separately. Use the split train data for building the model.
Extract features that are relevant for classification
Identify the target variable.
Do all the necessary pre-processing steps like One-hot encoding, Treating missing values, Standardization, converting categorical to numerical data, etc. wherever necessary.
Handle any class imbalance, if required.
Split the data into 80:20 for train and validation.
Apply different classifiers and check validation accuracy.
Calculate the cross-validation score, precision, recall and also display the confusion matrix.
Evaluate the accuracy on test set.
