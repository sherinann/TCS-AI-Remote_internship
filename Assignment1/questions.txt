Assignment 1:
1. Using Pandas, load the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris/data to a variable name iris
2. Create a list named headers with all the column header names in the given order.
3. Using the slice operation on headers, extract the column names with index 1 to 4 onto a list called features.
4. Display the first five records of iris
5. Make a scatterplot of the Iris features.
6. What is the range of ‘SepalLengthCm’ in the dataset? What is the second largest value of ‘SepalLengthCm’ in the dataset?
7. Find the mean of all the values in SepalWidthCm using numpy
8. Identify  ‘SepalLengthCm’  values less than 5. Create a new column named ‘Length’ , categorise each entry as ‘Small’ or ‘Large’, if less than 5.
9. Group dataFrame by the "Species" column. Make a histogram of the same.
10 .Find the deviation of length for ‘SepalLengthCm’ from the average
11 . Find correlation between columns and display columns with more than 70% percent correlation (either positive or negative).
12. Impute missing values if present using mean of the dataset.
13. Save the current dataFrame out to a new csv file.
